### Information Architecture

The website has been designed as a **single-page CV** to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.  
The navigation bar at the top allows users to quickly access each section through anchor links. The content is organized into four main sections:

1. **About Me:** A short introduction where the candidate expresses his interest in cybersecurity, information protection, and the continuous learning of security technologies.  
2. **Work Experience:** Highlights previous work experiences not directly related to computer engineering but relevant for developing soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and responsibility. This includes positions such as Kitchen Assistant and Member of GDG Girona.  
3. **Skills:** Lists the main technical abilities — including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Oracle — displayed in a simple bullet-point format.  
4. **Contact:** Provides easy access to the candidate’s email and GitHub profile.

This structure emphasizes **clarity and efficiency**, allowing recruiters or collaborators to find all necessary information without scrolling excessively or navigating through multiple pages.

### Visual Design

The visual identity of this project follows a **minimalist and modern aesthetic**, emphasizing readability and simplicity.  
- **Color palette:** The site uses a clean background with a combination of **blue (#007BFF)** and **teal green (#20C997)** for accents and highlights, symbolizing trust, technology, and innovation.  
- **Typography:** The chosen font, *Inter* (from Google Fonts), ensures excellent readability and a modern look. Titles use a slightly heavier weight (600) for hierarchy and emphasis.  
- **Layout:** The page layout is centered and responsive, optimized for desktop viewing while remaining usable on mobile devices thanks to a simple media query. Each section is visually separated with white space and subtle borders for clarity.  
- **Design philosophy:** Focused on usability and clean presentation rather than decorative elements. The design aims to convey professionalism, attention to detail, and a passion for technology and cybersecurity.

The simplicity of the design supports quick reading and navigation — essential qualities for a digital CV viewed by potential employers or collaborators.
